# Find The Difference

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.
String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to `t`.


## Example 1:

Input:

`s = "abcd"``
`t = "abcde"`

Output:

Output: `"e"`
> Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

## Example 2:

Input:

`s = ""`
`t = "y"`

Output:

`"y"`

## Example 3:

Input:

`s = "a" `
`t = "aa"`

Output:

`"a"`

## Example 4:

Input:

`s = "ae"`
`t = "aea"`

Output:

`"a"`
